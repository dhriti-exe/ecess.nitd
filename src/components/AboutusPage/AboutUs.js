      <div className="writings">
        The embryonic formation of the Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering
        was in the year 1983 with the introduction of an undergraduate course. Situated amidst
        lush green campus with teak plantations, the Department, over the time, has grown in
        several dimensions and provides a magnetic ambience in teaching and learning. The faculties
        are engaged in research in diverse topics focussing in Telecommunication, Antenna and Microwave,
        Microelectronics and VLSI, Signal and Image processing and Computational Systems Biology.
        It is well equipped with sophisticated laboratories in the areas of VLSI, Signal Processing,
        Microwave, Antenna and Wireless Communication. The Department has been supported by, SMDP for
        VLSI, DST-FIST for Wireless Communications and NPMASS for MEMS Research. Sponsored research
        from research initiation grant as well as DST and SERB have been initiated over the years.
        The Department is committed to impart quality education at undergraduate as well as
        postgraduate level and promulgate quality research in diverse fields of application of electronics engineering.
